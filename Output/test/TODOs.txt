PRIORITY 

TIER 1:
- Make histogram plot from output timestamps
- Change sim_time parameter to "start" and "end" (put timestamps together at the end) 


TIER 2:
- Integrate input function for simulated incoming timestamps in application_traffic
- Create default event_lists for background packets with multiple sets of parameters to load into simulation
- Integrate Multiprocessing (similar to
